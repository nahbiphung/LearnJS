    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 10;
    // let ageB = age;
    // console.log(age, ageB);

    // age = 30;
    // console.log(age, ageB);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Oai';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players];
    
    team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 100;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {number : 200, tall: '1m9'});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it
